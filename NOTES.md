# Day 1 Notes

## What I learned
- An API endpoint connects a URL to a Python function
- FastAPI automatically converts Python dictionaries to JSON
- Each endpoint handles one responsibility

## What confused me
How to commit, how JSON works, or @pp.get("/")
## What I will improve
- Replace fake employee data with a database later
